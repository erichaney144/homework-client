# String Theory - Music Store

This was my first React app. I've been meaning to learn React for a long time. It's a NextJS client app to demonstrate the capability of the server-app homework assignment.

It is running live on an EC2 instance here: http://54.190.62.35

## To run locally:

First run [the server](https://github.com/erichaney144/homework) locally

Then clone this repo and run:

```
yarn
echo 'SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8084' > .env.local
yarn dev
```
